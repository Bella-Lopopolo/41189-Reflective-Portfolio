## My learnings for each week - Isabella Lopopolo

### Week 2:


**What have I learnt this week?**

During this week's workshop my learnings were all about modelling. Through my activities I learnt how modelling can help us build our understanding of complex problems and a general understanding of what a model is. Through this learning I also discovered that there are different types of modelling and that I am seeing different types of models in our everyday world which I was surprised about as I didn’t realise these areas of our world interconnected with human-centred complex systems. Within the workshop I obtained a theory that models demonstrate transferability of ideas across many disciplines and that they are a representation or substitution of a real system. Through learning these different features and theories of modelling I can now say I proficiently understand all the basic foundational facts of modelling and how vital they are in complex systems. 
 

***What do I 'now know' that I did not before?***

Through attending the workshop, I now know the key concepts of modelling as I had not learnt or dealt with models a lot before therefore this whole concept was new to me. These key concepts include the typical modelling workflow, the three different types of models and the best type of model which is a Parsimony. These concepts particularly stood out to me in this lesson as something I didn’t know before as I find these points extremely important in identifying models and understanding the complexities of them and what they are depicting and explaining. 


**What insights have I gained?**

The main Insight I gained this week was that models can take many forms and all look very different, but their sole purpose is to all do the same thing which is to represent a system in a from which is easier to work with and identify the different features of in a more detailed way, due to it being the simplified version of the system. Another insight I gained is that realism can be measured objectively as an agreement to model outputs. I find this quite fascinating as the real world and its systems can be quite complexed and have many different options or paths to take, but due to models and the information the convey and what they output, all of this is simplified to a more unbiased form. 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**

This week I perceived that my strengths to do with the topic of models were that I grasped the general concepts quite quickly and was able to create my own notes on my learning rather than copying slide notes as I understood exactly what the different features of models were, which were being explained and due to me learning that models were all around us I was able to apply my knowledge to real life examples I came up with. 

My Weaknesses I observed this week was when we were answering one of the wisdoms of the crowd questions which was ‘what if different models are telling me different things? What should I do?’ A weakness here arose as I didn’t understand exactly what the question was asking therefore when I answered it, I was way off. Luckily Mr Ravindra explained what the question was asking of me and I then understood what my answer should have been and how to link it to the concepts we had learnt in the workshop. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 

The main challenge I encountered this week was trying to stay focused during the long class and keep up with what Mr Ravindra was talking about towards the end of the lesson. I struggled around that time as we had missed one of the breaks, so I needed to really concentrate to ensure I was noting all aspects of the lesson down. I feel I was able to handle this challenge well as I stayed on top of all the content given and I was able to learn a lot in this workshop which allowed me to build my own perception of models. 

 
**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 

Next time I will try to take notes in the small videos we watched within the workshops in order to get extra information relating to each topic. I think this will allow me to develop more examples of each area of the content and I regret only taking my own notes of the lecture slides and what Mr Ravindra was saying. I will benefit from doing this next class as through doing this I anticipate I will have more notes to revise on each topic when needed, and I may even get more enriched examples to use in each subject area. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 

The theory of parsimony where the best model is always the one which achieves the greatest realism with the easiest framework of complexity and least model complexity. Is a theory I find very useful as it allows me to build an understanding of the frameworks of models which work to their full potential and I also learnt from this that the simplest models can convey so much knowledge to its viewers which can allow a simpler way to build a great understanding. 

 



### Week 3: 

**What have I learnt this week?** 

To reflect upon the learning process in this workshop is can be said that I learnt a variety of subtopic areas which fall under the topic of supermarket models. These topic areas included: 

- Models of how people behave  

- Models of how people decide  

- Models of how people conceal or reveal information 

- Models of value and power 

- How People Solve Problems in Groups 

By learning these subtopic areas, I found I built knowledge upon how humans thought processes connect to models and what each of these thought processes or actions can lead to and what they mean. This learning proved valuable in holistically understanding modelling and models as I now proficiently am aware of how behaviours and decisions and information relates to models which can prepare me for my group project coming up. 


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 

Through attending this workshop, I now know that psychology itself is a model which has different subsections. I found this particularly interesting as I was not aware that though processes and actions of humans can be defined as models. Knowing this now not only assists me in this class or other classes I take but it also allows me to further understand human thought concepts and generate a further understanding on people's perceptions and opinions, categorising them in either behavioural model thinkers, rational or rule based. 


**What insights have I gained?** 

Upon reflection, I gathered that the insights I gained within this workshop include that there are four variations of rule-based models which people can use. Personally, this is seen as an insight as I thought there was only one type of rule-based models which was that they are fixed. But realistically they can also be adaptive, Choice made can be a decision based on sole agent or Choice made can be based on a game (multiple agents). Therefore, I was able to build a greater comprehension on rule-based models. 

 
**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 

In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe my strengths and weaknesses. I believe my strengths within this workshop was that I was actively processing and listening to all the information being taught to me which furthermore allowed me to answer all example questions provided in the slides which means I can apply the knowledge learnt. 

My weaknesses I observed weren't major as they were overcome quickly but were in the area of probability, particularly in decision trees. I considered this area a weakness as it took me a few times reading over the slides of this topic to finally understand and take in what they do and how they work. I believe the decision trees became a weakness for me temporarily as their flow-chart-like format is not how my brain usually connects with or works with taking in information therefore it took a little to get used to them and their purpose. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 

The challenges I reflect upon which I encountered within this Week 3 workshop is that the slides of the workshops and what Mr Ravindra was saying was extremely content heavy therefore I needed to type extremely fast whilst also ensuring I was understanding and taking in the knowledge and was able to apply it to examples. I handled this by pacing myself when typing and ensuring I was summarising only the important facts so that I didn’t waste time writing extra words etc. I also didn’t get too worried or caught up if I missed any info, as by doing that it would have made me flustered and miss more. I told myself I could go get the slides off Canvas and catch up on any missed knowledge there. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 

Next time in order to improve I reflect that I will be catch-up on any slide info I missed when typing or listening to Mr Ravindra, within the break times to ensure I know all knowledge which will lead to the next slide topic of learning. The anticipated results will be that I don’t have to do more note taking outside of the class on top of my GitHub reflection but also, I will understand and have noted down all topic areas, allowing me to understand how it will be leading onto the next topic for the workshop. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 

Upon reflection I have realised a theory learnt in this week's workshop which proved to be useful was, that we shouldn’t presume behavioural models are rational, and we should observe how they behave, then use the observations to make a distinction of whether the model of how people behave should showing rational or irrational traits. I have learnt from this theory that not everything is the easiest or most obvious seeming possibility as it’s believed most humans behave rationally. Instead, we must look more detailed into their mannerisms and use this in our models in order to display an understanding of all biases and heuristics.
