## My learnings for each week - Isabella Lopopolo

### Week 2:


**What have I learnt this week?**


During this week's workshop my learnings were all about modelling. Through my activities I learnt how modelling can help us build our understanding of complex problems and a general understanding of what a model is. Through this learning I also discovered that there are different types of modelling and that I am seeing different types of models in our everyday world which I was surprised about as I didn’t realise these areas of our world interconnected with human-centred complex systems. Within the workshop I obtained a theory that models demonstrate transferability of ideas across many disciplines and that they are a representation or substitution of a real system. Through learning these different features and theories of modelling I can now say I proficiently understand all the basic foundational facts of modelling and how vital they are in complex systems. 
 


***What do I 'now know' that I did not before?***


Through attending the workshop, I now know the key concepts of modelling as I had not learnt or dealt with models a lot before therefore this whole concept was new to me. These key concepts include the typical modelling workflow, the three different types of models and the best type of model which is a Parsimony. These concepts particularly stood out to me in this lesson as something I didn’t know before as I find these points extremely important in identifying models and understanding the complexities of them and what they are depicting and explaining. 


**What insights have I gained?**

The main Insight I gained this week was that models can take many forms and all look very different, but their sole purpose is to all do the same thing which is to represent a system in a from which is easier to work with and identify the different features of in a more detailed way, due to it being the simplified version of the system. Another insight I gained is that realism can be measured objectively as an agreement to model outputs. I find this quite fascinating as the real world and its systems can be quite complexed and have many different options or paths to take, but due to models and the information the convey and what they output, all of this is simplified to a more unbiased form. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**


This week I perceived that my strengths to do with the topic of models were that I grasped the general concepts quite quickly and was able to create my own notes on my learning rather than copying slide notes as I understood exactly what the different features of models were, which were being explained and due to me learning that models were all around us I was able to apply my knowledge to real life examples I came up with. 

My Weaknesses I observed this week was when we were answering one of the wisdoms of the crowd questions which was ‘what if different models are telling me different things? What should I do?’ A weakness here arose as I didn’t understand exactly what the question was asking therefore when I answered it, I was way off. Luckily Mr Ravindra explained what the question was asking of me and I then understood what my answer should have been and how to link it to the concepts we had learnt in the workshop. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


The main challenge I encountered this week was trying to stay focused during the long class and keep up with what Mr Ravindra was talking about towards the end of the lesson. I struggled around that time as we had missed one of the breaks, so I needed to really concentrate to ensure I was noting all aspects of the lesson down. I feel I was able to handle this challenge well as I stayed on top of all the content given and I was able to learn a lot in this workshop which allowed me to build my own perception of models. 


 
**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Next time I will try to take notes in the small videos we watched within the workshops in order to get extra information relating to each topic. I think this will allow me to develop more examples of each area of the content and I regret only taking my own notes of the lecture slides and what Mr Ravindra was saying. I will benefit from doing this next class as through doing this I anticipate I will have more notes to revise on each topic when needed, and I may even get more enriched examples to use in each subject area. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


The theory of parsimony where the best model is always the one which achieves the greatest realism with the easiest framework of complexity and least model complexity. Is a theory I find very useful as it allows me to build an understanding of the frameworks of models which work to their full potential and I also learnt from this that the simplest models can convey so much knowledge to its viewers which can allow a simpler way to build a great understanding. 

 



### Week 3: 


**What have I learnt this week?** 


To reflect upon the learning process in this workshop it can be said that I learnt a variety of subtopic areas which fall under the topic of supermarket models. These topic areas included: 

- Models of how people behave  

- Models of how people decide  

- Models of how people conceal or reveal information 

- Models of value and power 

- How People Solve Problems in Groups 

By learning these subtopic areas, I found I built knowledge upon how humans thought processes connect to models and what each of these thought processes or actions can lead to and what they mean. This learning proved valuable in holistically understanding modelling and models as I now proficiently am aware of how behaviours and decisions and information relates to models which can prepare me for my group project coming up. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Through attending this workshop, I now know that psychology itself is a model which has different subsections. I found this particularly interesting as I was not aware that though processes and actions of humans can be defined as models. Knowing this now not only assists me in this class or other classes I take but it also allows me to further understand human thought concepts and generate a further understanding on people's perceptions and opinions, categorising them in either behavioural model thinkers, rational or rule based. 



**What insights have I gained?** 


Upon reflection, I gathered that the insights I gained within this workshop include that there are four variations of rule-based models which people can use. Personally, this is seen as an insight as I thought there was only one type of rule-based models which was that they are fixed. But realistically they can also be adaptive, Choice made can be a decision based on sole agent or Choice made can be based on a game (multiple agents). Therefore, I was able to build a greater comprehension on rule-based models. 

 
 
**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


In reflecting upon the tutorial exercise, it was useful to observe my strengths and weaknesses. I believe my strengths within this workshop was that I was actively processing and listening to all the information being taught to me which furthermore allowed me to answer all example questions provided in the slides which means I can apply the knowledge learnt. 

My weaknesses I observed weren't major as they were overcome quickly but were in the area of probability, particularly in decision trees. I considered this area a weakness as it took me a few times reading over the slides of this topic to finally understand and take in what they do and how they work. I believe the decision trees became a weakness for me temporarily as their flow-chart-like format is not how my brain usually connects with or works with taking in information therefore it took a little to get used to them and their purpose. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


The challenges I reflect upon which I encountered within this Week 3 workshop is that the slides of the workshops and what Mr Ravindra was saying was extremely content heavy therefore I needed to type extremely fast whilst also ensuring I was understanding and taking in the knowledge and was able to apply it to examples. I handled this by pacing myself when typing and ensuring I was summarising only the important facts so that I didn’t waste time writing extra words etc. I also didn’t get too worried or caught up if I missed any info, as by doing that it would have made me flustered and miss more. I told myself I could go get the slides off Canvas and catch up on any missed knowledge there. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Next time in order to improve I reflect that I will be catch-up on any slide info I missed when typing or listening to Mr Ravindra, within the break times to ensure I know all knowledge which will lead to the next slide topic of learning. The anticipated results will be that I don’t have to do more note taking outside of the class on top of my GitHub reflection but also, I will understand and have noted down all topic areas, allowing me to understand how it will be leading onto the next topic for the workshop. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?**


Upon reflection I have realised a theory learnt in this week's workshop which proved to be useful was, that we shouldn’t presume behavioural models are rational, and we should observe how they behave, then use the observations to make a distinction of whether the model of how people behave should showing rational or irrational traits. I have learnt from this theory that not everything is the easiest or most obvious seeming possibility as it’s believed most humans behave rationally. Instead, we must look more detailed into their mannerisms and use this in our models in order to display an understanding of all biases and heuristics. 





### Week 4: 


**What have I learnt this week?** 


Through reflecting upon my learnings for this lesson I believe the main stand outs of my learning were the diagrams, Causal loop diagram which is a diagram which graphically represents the relationships between several variables within a problem or situation. The most interesting area of learning within the causal loop diagram topic was where we went off in groups to make our version of this diagram based off a problem. I found this area most fundamental to stimulating my learning as it allowed me to understand how to put this diagram together effectively. By pulling a part a scenario then putting it together as a casual loop diagram, I was able to further build an understanding of the flow and how the casual loop diagrams are used as a model and how they inform people through their displays.  



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Upon reflection I have gathered that what I now know which I did not before is that there is more than one mode of behaviour which are fundamental in models. This learning was interesting to me as it forced me to reflect on past knowledge and made me question why I only thought there was one mode of behaviour as it makes perfect sense that there are six which all meet their own individual purpose, and all evoke different model outcomes. I also was not aware that all these different modes of behaviour were split into two subcategories, fundamental which are: 

- Exponential growth & decay 

- Goal seeking 

- Oscillation 

And common which are: 

- S shaped Growth 

- Growth with overshoot 

- Overshoot and collapse 

All these different behavioural modes have individual unique interpretations but share connections between structures which assist in creating hypotheses, which is why it's so fundamental that I now know all this beneficial information as in my mind prior to learning this, I believed behavioural models were a lot less complexed. 



**What insights have I gained?** 


Through reflecting on this week's workshop, I believe I gained great insight on the three different logics behind network formations which can be either random, preferential attachment and small world. I reflect that for me the logic behind network foundations are now insights as I have built a deep understanding of the different aspects of each logical foundation, understand what they best accurately represent and how they are formed. I also have such a great understanding that I can make links to real-life examples of the different logics behind network foundations. For example, small world foundational networks can be used to describe animal food chains/webs and random network foundations can be used to graph the global spread of coronavirus throughout different countries. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


Looking back on this week's workshop I have perceived that my strength for this topic is being able to completely understand measures of network structures particularly the area of shortest paths. I reflect that this area is my main strength as I have prior experience of these teachings due to high school learnings in maths. I believe it is a strength as I understood each component of measuring network structures completely and didn’t require any extra learning to understand the concepts.  

I reflect that a weakness I experienced through this workshop is being able to read and understand the flows of stabilising loops and how they balance the feedbacks. I struggled in this area as I found it difficult to read the different flows given as examples in the slides then understand what they are representing and the method they are showing. Therefore, upon reflection I need to work on this area more in order to transform this weakness into a strength. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


Challenges my team and I experienced whilst in our breakout room were that we struggled to create a causal loop diagram and a stock flow diagram while on a zoom call. This proved to be difficult as this task required us to build a whole diagram and converse our ideas whilst we weren't together. In order to overcome this challenge, we created a google doc where we were all able to all lay out our ideas and opinions of how the diagram should be drawn, then discuss them all and create the diagram using shapes on the document. This way we were all able to contribute as a group and choose the best solution as a group. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Upon reflection I have realised that in order to improve, next time I will ask more questions about areas I don’t understand or am struggling with, such as in this lesson being able to read and understand the flows of stabilising loops and how they balance the feedbacks. This is because I need to overcome being shy on zoom calls and use Mr Ravindra and his teachings to my advantage and use my questions to learn faster for me to understand sooner rather than later. This will furthermore assist me rather than having to try to understand my weaknesses by myself. It will be a smarter and more effective way to learn. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


I believe through looking back at the workshop that the most effective and useful theory taught was the Stocks and Flows system being represented as the bathtub analogy. This theory was useful as it applied the learnings into a more realistic and real-life scenario therefore, I found that I understood it a lot faster and it made a lot of sense to me when put into this theory. Through this theory I learnt that stocks, which are the foundational elements of any system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time, can flow in and out at different rates which can influence a change in the stocks overtime due to the actions of the flows. 




### Week 5: 


**What have I learnt this week?** 


Upon reflection I gathered that what I learnt this week was about the probability distributions and how to understand and develop intuition on how actions and decisions join and connect to form a complex system. I learnt these through understanding how things aggregate which was exposed to us through disassembling the characteristics of a complex system and identifying how each area flows to the next. We also learnt how biases and different forms of network can display aggregation of action. My learnings for this area of human-centred complex systems really increased when I related my personal actions of aggregation such as my decisions, interactions, and preferences to build an understanding which I can relate to more as I find it allows me to absorb all the facts I've learnt holistically for each topic. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Through reflecting I have realised that what I now know which I did not before is that probability distribution is the representation of values or outcomes that a random variable may have and that these can show how likely one could find the possible values of random variable. I believe this is a new piece of knowledge as before I thought probability distribution was why certain probabilities happen rather than it being a list of possible outcomes a variable could have. Now that I know this, I can completely understand how each outcome can link to a random variable. 



**What insights have I gained?** 


When reflecting on this workshop I realised that an insight I gained was that there were two different types of variables. One being Discrete random variables which are ones that have either a finite or countable number of possible outcomes, therefore, you can calculate its value through counting. An example of a Discrete random variables is the number of different nationalities in a country. The other type of variable is Continuous random variables which are uncountable and have an infinite number of possible values, these values are calculated by measuring. An example of this is the weather. This to me is considered an insight as by identifying and learning that there are two different types of variables I can build a greater and deeper understanding of variables and their relation to probability. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


My perceived strengths that I have observed through reflecting upon this topic are that I found this class a breeze as I understood all that was being taught quite easily and didn’t overcomplicate my learnings in my head as I sometimes do, which can confuse me. I was able to stay on top of the work and understand the benefits behind the group activities we had to complete also. 

My weaknesses however were that I didn’t take as many notes during this class due to me understanding everything so well. Therefore, through reflecting I gathered it would have been smarter of me to take notes even if I did understand to well so that later I can go back and revise them. I consider this a weakness as I was more listening to what was being discussed rather than multitasking like I normally do, where I listen and note take at the same time. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


Challenges I encountered were when we went off into to complete different tasks as a group, this is due to it being difficult to create diagrams as a group when we all weren't together as we struggled all contributing and conveying all our ideas to each other. We attempted to use a google doc which was a slow start, but we eventually were able to get most of the task done, however I would have liked to get them all done. Personally, I don’t think we handled the challenge well as a team as it ended up being myself and two others doing all the work which his disappointing considering there were 6-7 of us in the group. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


In the future I will motivate my team to divide all tasks evenly throughout the group so that as a team everyone works together and to ensure everyone works on the tasks. The anticipated results of this improvement will ensure everyone's ideas are heard and that all the tasks required are completed within the hour Mr Ravindra provided us with. Then all our learning can be benefited. 

Another element of the workshop I will improve in next time is when presenting the group work, we created I will in future, plan out what I'm going to say more in order to ensure I am clear and concise with my presentation of our findings and representations of our learning. If I improve on this my presentation will be a lot shorter and easier to follow rather than me having to take time reading what I've written to know which points to include right as everyone is listening to me present. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


Upon reflection I believe a theory which proved to be useful to my learning was that the size of the power law’s exponent determines the likelihood and size of large events. This theory was useful as it allowed me to further understand how power laws and their formulas work to represent or calculate events. This proved to be useful as it allowed me to gather a perception of why companies such as AMAZON use power laws and how certain models can produce different power laws. 




### Week 6:


**What have I learnt this week?** 


Upon reflection this week I learnt how complex systems evolve and change over time. This broad learning was gathered through more specific learnings such as what Markov Models are and their processes and also what random walk models are and how they fit into complex systems within our world. Something particularly interesting that I reflect I learnt is that Markov Models are particularly flexible, and are able to be applied to many situations as they are extremely simple to implement as all possible probabilities are able to be applied to all participants within the system and its processes. Another interesting learning, I gained through this workshop was the inner workings of the random walk models. I learnt that each step within the random walk model is independent of one another but each step has 2 paths of equal likelihood, this path taken for each step is completely random. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Upon reflection what I now know that I did not before is the inner workings of the Convergence Theorem, AKA Perron-Frobenius Theorem. This is the underlying assumptions of Markov processes and they are as follows: 

1. Finite number of states 

2. Fixed transition probabilities 

3. Can eventually get from any state to another. (must be some way of transitioning between any two states (ergodicity)) 

4. Not a simple cycle, i.e..it doesn’t just deterministically cycle between two or three, etc. States. 

Through obtaining this knowledge furthermore what I now know that I did not before is that if these four conditions are all met in the system, the system converges into one unique equilibrium which is extremely interesting. I also now know that there are implications of these 4 underlying processes which vary from the history of the system not mattering, intervening to change the different states won’t work and that Change is temporary if transition probabilities stay the same 



**What insights have I gained?** 


Through reflecting I realised insights I gained this week within the workshop is that percolation, riots, broadcasts, diffusion, and contagion are model ways we transfer information throughout our world.  These make epidemiology, communication and information systems occur as they act as central roles in each area. I built a deeper understanding that these models we examined are highly non-linear, which means that a small change can create a big effect which is extremely disproportional. Through learning these insights, I have a greater understanding of the inner workings of the systems within our world and how different concepts and systems work together to produce another system. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


Upon reflection this week I believe my perceived strengths are that I am on top of all my group work for the assignment and I have a lot of motivation to complete my required work as I have interest in the topic. Another one of my strengths is that when working in my group I give my suggestion then as for their opinions on my suggestion to ensure everyone is involved in decision making and is getting involved in the group assignment, this also links to my strength of evenly delegating work when people are unsure of what they need to do, which was required of me this week when working on our assignment. 

A weakness I have observed is that I sometimes lose confidence in myself and my judgement when working with other people and sometimes shy away of sharing my own opinions as I fear the other group members might think I'm being bossy or trying to takeover. Upon reflection I have realised this weakness can easily be transformed into a strength and that I shouldn’t shy away from sharing my opinions as people will more than likely have thought similar to my idea or like the angle, I took my opinion rather than thinking negatively about it. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


A Challege I encountered along with my assignment group was that we had to change our research question for our report so late into the semester which significantly set us back. We needed to change our research question due to it not addressing the assignment question properly as our original question was too broad, we needed to get more specific. My team and I handled this challenge well as when we found out from Mr Ravindra that the question was incorrect, we got straight onto a group call to devise a more fitting question. Once this was handled, we came up with a more appropriate question for the assignment, which also didn’t force us to delete previous work we had done, which was positive. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Upon reflection I have come to conclusion that next time to improve, on our group call I would jot down notes for everyone in order to ensure we don’t forget what we discussed and what everyone said during the calls. This will allow us all to keep track of ideas and not forget them in the moment chaos when everyone is enthusiastically expressing their ideas and opinions, which would furthermore set our ideas out in a format which his easiest to go through and select the best option for our group. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


Upon reflection a theory which proved to be useful was the path of dependence theory which is that whatever occurs from a certain moment forward depends on the preceding moments or the path before that we took to get here. I learnt this theory by going through the extra readings provided, following the workshop and it proved to be useful as it allowed me to create a holistic understanding of why things occur. I then related these understandings to a real-life situation which was a business's economic stability and how its stability is entirely dependent on the economic history and journey that the business has been through and what changes it made as changes can either be positive and negative in a business. Through being able to connect this theory to other subjects in my course I learnt more about how things work and why things occur through this model theory and was able to compare the theory to Markov theories where history doesn’t affect future events. 




### Week 7:


**What have I learnt this week?** 


This week I learnt about replicator dynamics which are known to be models of social learning this is due to learning occurring through watching actions of others and identifying the probability of taking actions and how popular these actions are and what rewards can result of these actions. Upon reflection I realised that my primary learning of replicator dynamics was that they can be used in a variety of different disciplines which range from Psychology, ecology and economics, which is extremely interesting as these three disciplines have different cores and different outcomes, with psychology replication dynamics modelling learning, ecology replicator dynamics modelling evolution and economics modelling populations of people learning. Through this topic I also learnt how the incentive of rewards can influence probability as people are more inclined to change or decide on an action which results in a reward for themselves which is basically what replicator dynamics models model, they follow and display social actions and shows how probability distributions change overtime due to rewards achieved through certain actions. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Upon reflection this week through my group work and workshop participation what I now know what I did not before is that our assignment topic of “Modelling the social, economic and environmental impacts of an oil spill to determine how the impacts can be lessened” contained elements of social contagion which means it is driven by high variance rather than mean behaviour this is due to every system involved (social, economic and environmental) having different variation reactions to oil spills that can furthermore act as a flowing effect which results in negative impacts upon the systems individual stakeholders and their links. There is no average behaviour which the systems follow once being exposed to the oil, they all have individual reactions which all vary and occur due to their individual connection to the ocean and what it produces. 



**What insights have I gained?** 


Through reflecting I realised and acknowledged that the primary insight I gained this week was to do with my group and how they personally work through each assignment and what their thought processes are. Through building this deeper understanding of how they manage tasks and an appreciation of how they interact with other group members which results in me gaining an awareness of how we should tackle the task at hand to ensure we are all working together in ways each group member responds to positively and that everyone's opinions and ideas are being acknowledged so that everyone participates. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


Upon reflection my perceived strengths this week was definitely in the research area of our group assignment as I found I was “ON A ROLE” with finding viable and informative sources and information which can be used in our group assignment. I perceive this as a strength as I believe I worked very hard and assisted my team mates with researching for their parts which will really boost our assignment in a positive way. 

A perceived weakness that I observed upon reflection on my actions from this week was that I particularly struggled finding motivation to begin/continue my writing process as I found I was procrastinating. I believe I was procrastinating by researching, as I wasn’t sure where I should start certain aspects of my part and where I should take the existing areas I had already written. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


When reflecting on this week I identified a challenge we encountered which was that for aspects of our assignment criteria which we needed to meet, there wasn’t a lot of viable information to use after extensive research was completed. This was a challenge encountered as it meant as a group, we had to devise a solution as we needed to address these areas of the report in order to get criteria marks. We handled this challenge well and devised a solution where we had to look in different areas such as the UTS Library website where we found research journals and articles, we could use for this area we struggled with. Therefore, the challenge was overcome. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


What I would do better next time is setting myself a word limit for each section of the report that I have been assigned to do, this is so I’m not writing crazy amounts of words in the future when there is no word limit on the assignments as I believe this will allow me to be more concise with my work and not include details which aren't necessary or required. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


Upon reflection I think the Fisher's theorem has proven to be most useful and is the rate of adaptation is proportional to the variation in that population. This theory taught me that when things are adapting through evolution an increased number of different variations such as characteristics, strategies and phenotypes, make the adaption process move faster. This theory is useful particularly when applying it to my assignment as it means I have a greater understanding on what increases adaptivity for animals and humans which therefore can be applied when we are modelling our solution. 




### Week 8: 


**What have I learnt this week?**


Upon reflection this week I learnt about game theory, the Colonel Blotto Game, in particular which is a zero-sum game that can predict winner sand losers based on their choices to allocate their limited resources across numerous different fronts. We learnt that this game theory is re-emerging due to its relevance and real-world application in areas such as politics and social / competetive situations. I learnt within the workshop that this game has a clear winner and loser due to this game being based solely on competition between two parties, however in some situations all players can be defeated, the winner depends on which route was taken first. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Through reflecting I realised that following this workshop something I now know which I did not before is that a real-world application of the Colonel Blotto Game is in court trials. I did not realise types of models such as these game theories can be represented in this way, and I now know that this game theory applies as lawyers clash over different arguments which in the game can be seen as lines of defence. The resource in use is the evidence and the time they spent preparing the lines of defence to combat their opponent, the opposing solicitors attack. Therefore, to win they need to apply their time correctly to build a strong defence. 



**What insights have I gained?**


Upon reflection an insight I gained this week was how straight forward models can represent real-life situations and just how accurately they depict the world around us. I am aware this insight was gained in previous weeks; however, it was further built upon, and I was able to gather a deeper and greater understanding of just how extensive the examples of modelling real-life situations are, for example I didn’t think before this lesson that elections can be modelled using game theory or that hiring of a person can be explained in this way also. Therefore, this lesson gave me a greater awareness of how so many models can be modelled accordingly.  



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**


My perceived strengths for this week were that I completed my assignment work ahead of the schedule I had set myself as I time-managed extremely well this week to complete my work to the best of my ability and ensure I met all criteria point on the marking guidelines. This strength was observed as following my completion of my work I was able to assist my group within the submission area, where I set out a scaffold which everyone could place their work in once they had finished so that, Rob only had to copy and paste all the work into a document to submit rather than having to try and put everyone else work in order etc. Therefore, I think finishing my work ahead of schedule assisted my team greatly. 

A perceived weakness however was that I was extremely nervous about the submission and was unsure if my teammates were finished their areas as I hadn't heard from them in a day or so, therefore, through my frustration I was contacting them a lot on the group chat which could have distracted them from actually focusing on their work, Therefore, it was wrong on my behalf as I should have trusted that they would all get their required work done in time, which they did. Therefore, next time I will take a step back and not worry as they were all on top of their work! 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


Upon reflection a challenge I encountered this week was finding motivation to continue writing my responses for the report, this was due to my area being quite a big part of the assignment which required a lot of detail, which is something I didn’t realise before starting. This is due to each system having numerous stakeholders which react differently to the toxicity of the oil spills. I think I lacked a little motivation as in entirety my part (2 sections of the report) was over 4,000 words which is significant and took a lot of persistence to continue to write about the different stakeholders and models in such detail, but also as it was the largest piece of writing I have ever written. I believe I overcame this challenge very well as I pushed myself to continue and to find motivation, which was found in me really enjoying the topic. In the end through overcoming this challenge I completed my area ahead of the personal schedule I had set myself, as I put my head down and got to work efficiently. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Upon reflection I have realised that next time to improve and do better I will ensure to be more aware of what my group members are doing for the assignment, this is because I was under the impression that for this draft pre-submission we had to complete our section and assigned area in full for this submission, therefore I did and put a lot of time doing so, whereas the rest of the group knew we only had to do brief dot points of what we planned to write in our specific area therefore I was the one of the only or the only person to write their answers in full finalised sentences. In the future if I communicate with how my group members are writing their section, I could save some time and be more up to date with where my other group members stand, however in this instance I think I was lucky I wrote it in time for the pre-submission as it can now all be marked and critiqued so I can make changes and improve it. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


Through reflection I acknowledged that a theory I learnt this week which proved useful was that the Colonel Blotto Game theory demonstrates that having more resources doesn’t guarantee victory which means that there is no best strategy on winning as anyone can win. I learnt from this that no matter what your given you can always try and use it to the best of your ability to achieve a positive outcome. This proves to be useful in real-world situations as no matter what cards you are drawn, you will always be able to form a positive outcome if you choose to apply your resources in the correct areas or fields e.g., applying time into hard work. 




### Week 9: 


**What have I learnt this week?** 


Upon reflection this week I learnt through a video conference with Mr Ravindra, Anushree and two other members of my group, how we can actively improve our pre-submission report before our final submission is due. Through this conversation I learnt that we were on track with what was required of us, however we learnt that we needed to take the next step in our assignment where we decide to either take the coding option or the non-coding option. Once exposed to the fact that there are now two options, we learnt exactly what each of the options entail. Through this I learnt that the coding option required a mathematical implementation of each of our three models, along with creating both boundaries and outcomes of each of the models using coding. Whereas the non-coding option involves creating and discussing a Causal Loop Diagram in relation to our topic and problem. Through reflecting on these new learnings which were vital for the completion of our assignment, I realised that I have no coding experience and therefore if we were to choose this option I would struggle. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Through reflecting on our video conference with the tutors, what I now know which I did not before is that our assignment topic and problem is way too broad to accurately move onto the next section of the report where we select one of the two options, coding or non-coding. I didn’t know this was the case as I hadn't completely grasped the concept of what was required for us in the next step, but I now know that for either option we must produce outcomes of the problem in model form, therefore it will be easier for us to do so if we refine our topic through making it all about a certain region or geographical location. 



**What insights have I gained?** 


After some reflection I identified that an insight made this week was that modelling can be both complexed to create and simple. This is due to some models such as partially hidden markov models and system dynamics models requiring coding to display their outcomes which can be extremely complexed to create, whereas its simple to create a causal loop diagram. This insight was created as my group was further looking into what option to select for our final submission and it was found that the different options for modelling show a distinct difference between models which are complexed to create and simpler to create. This insight allowed me to build a further understanding of what elements are required when modelling. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


Upon reflection my perceived strengths for this week were that during our group conference I actively asked questions whilst I had the time to get as many insights into the assessment task as possible. This was a perceived strength as I had improved from previous weeks where I was shy to ask questions and now, I was more confident to and devised intuitive questions which provided me with answers that allowed me to progress and understand the assessment task properly. 

A perceived weakness that I observed was that it took me a while to understand the different component options of the assignment, as I didn’t fully understand that no matter what option we chose out of the coding or non-coding we don’t change the topics of what was being discussed in the previous submission we just continue in either direction. I further didn’t completely understand what the coding option required of us until it was explained to me a few times. This is an observed weakness as initially it wasn’t processed properly in my mind until a lot of explanation, which unfortunately took a significant amount of time which could be used for working on the task. 



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


A challenge that was observed to have been encountered through reflection was that as a group we struggled to decide unanimously which pathway option top chose for the final submission task as there were mixed opinions of which option suited our group and the dynamics and skills more. This is due to one of our group members being adamant that the coding option was the best option as it seemed more interesting to do. However, myself and the other team members were more rational in thinking that we don’t know enough about coding to execute the task properly and effectively to allow our report to flow and make sense. This situation was handled extremely maturely by my team and after great discussion we concluded that the non-coding option suited us and our skillset more. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Through reflecting I decided that next time to improve I will give my group members more time to speak and ask questions during the group call. This occurred but could be improved as I felt I was asking a lot of questions to understand the task for everyone, and I had pre-prepared questions, whereas I wasn’t aware of what my team wanted to ask at the time as we weren't together, we were virtually connecting. In the future when I try this, I infer the anticipated results will be that everyone's queries are answered but also it will seem we are more cohesive if we are all actively asking questions. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


The cognitive learning theory proved to be useful when reflecting particularly on my weakness observed this week. This theory explains how the mind works during the learning process, and much like a computer, the mind absorbs information, processes it then uses the information to produce learning outcomes. This theory was useful for me to reflect on my weakness faced this week and how to understand and improve it. This is due to the theory teaching me that human minds have glitches and don’t process everything as quick as we think it should be, this is because every mind functions uniquely and there are different types of learning qualities which respond to individuals differently. 




### Week 10: 



**What have I learnt this week?** 


Upon reflection this week I learnt the different aspects and elements involved in creating a functional causal loop diagram. The elements I learnt include the variables which in our groups case would be the stakeholders within each of the social, economic and environmental systems. There are also the links between the variables and the signs on these links which show how the variables interconnect. There is also a sign on the loop which shows what type of behaviour the system will produce. These elements were a fundamental learning of mine to ensure I created a functional causal loop diagram for our project which depicts all variables and all possible outcomes of the problem. 



**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** 


Through reflecting I observed that what I now know which I did not know before was that for the non-coding aspect of our project, we are able to address and identify potential interventions which can be placed into the causal loop diagram to set the problem faced by the stakeholders of the social, economic and environmental systems right. This was an aspect of the project which I wasn’t aware of but am thankful that we have the opportunity to devise and create these interventions to have an idea which can completely fix the issues oil spillages create and make a positive impact on the different systems. 



**What insights have I gained?** 


Upon reflection an insight I gained this week was about the true meaning behind the plus and minus sign elements on the causal loop diagrams. These meanings were that the plus signs indicate a positive relation to the variable and a link marked with a minus sign indicates a negative relation. A positive link means the two variables change in the same direction whereas a negative link means the two variables change in opposite directions. This insight gained was fundamental to understanding how to collate a causal loop diagram correctly. 



**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** 


My perceived strengths that I observed for this week was that I was actively working on our project to work towards its completion. This was seen as a perceived strength of mine due to the long period of time we have had to work on this project which involves many elements. I believe this persistent motivation is a strength as some people around this period where we are inching closer to the deadline would start to slack off and be unmotivated as the project has been worked on for nearly 10 weeks. Therefore, I am proud of the fact that I was able to muster the motivation and continue to work hard on the project without complaints. 

The perceived weakness for this week that I observed of the group was that there was a lack of communication between the members this week compared to previous weeks. I feel this occurred due to the stage we are at for the project and the fact that we all didn’t have many or any questions this week regarding the project, so we all felt no need to communicate massively. This can be seen as a weakness as its always important to maintain communication between group members to ensure everyone is motivated and is up to the standards they need to be at for the project, therefore in other words it's important to check in with each other.  



**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** 


Upon reflection the challenges we encountered this week was having a lack of questions to ask Mr Ravindra and Anushree in the zoom project question drop in. As a group we tried to discuss and develop some questions on the project which we wanted answered but were unable to create any. Despite communicating and attempting to formulate questions we were unable to make any which is why I believe we didn’t handle the challenge well as we missed a vital chance for questions to be answered since we all thought we knew what was going on in the project. 



**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** 


Through reflecting I have realised that next time what I what I would do better to improve is prior to the zoom project question drop in I will set aside a time to brainstorm some questions or grey areas I have of the project elements and outlines rather than on the day panicking that we don't have any questions to ask. This will allow more time to devise ideas of areas we aren't quite certain about and to give ourselves time to think as this will most likely develop question ideas so that we can make use of the question time given to us specifically for this project. 



**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** 


The theory of motivation which is the study of understanding what drives a person to work towards a particular goal or outcome, this is relevant to all of society but is especially important in management of projects and work because a motivated worker is more productive, and a more productive worker achieves more goals. This theory proved useful to me as it allowed me to understand why I had particular motivations to continue to work on our project consistently and motivated me even more to work hard and think deeper about the project as I know through this theory, I learnt that if I do so I will achieve more. Furthermore, I learnt that people are more motivated than others if they have clearer goals of what they want to achieve.
